    <p style="font-family:verdana;">This article is about the original company founded by Ettore Bugatti. For the
        present-day company, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Automobiles">Bugatti Automobiles</a>.
        For other uses, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_(disambiguation)">Bugatti
            (disambiguation)</a>.</p>

    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance
        automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born
        industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and numerous race victories.
        Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57 "Atlantic" and
        the Type 55 sports car.</p>

    <p style="font-family:verdana;">The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow to the marque, and
        the death of his son Jean in 1939 meant that there was no successor to lead the factory with no more than about
        8,000 cars made. The company struggled financially, and it released one last model in the 1950s before
        eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.</p>

    <p style="font-family:verdana;">In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name and revived it as <b>Bugatti
            Automobili S.p.A.</b></p>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(2, 71, 120); font-size: 30px;">Racing successes</h2>

    <hr>

    <p style="font-family:verdana;">The company also enjoyed great success in early Grand Prix motor racing: in 1929, a
        privately entered Bugatti won the first ever Monaco Grand Prix. Bugatti's racing success culminated with driver
        Jean-Pierre Wimille winning the 24 hours of Le Mans twice (in 1937 with Robert Benoist and in 1939 with Pierre
        Veyron).
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Bugatti cars were extremely successful in racing. The little Bugatti Type 10 swept
        the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 Bugatti Type 35 is one of the most successful racing cars -
        developed by Bugatti with master engineer and racing driver Jean Chassagne who also drove it in the car's first
        ever Grand Prix in 1924 Lyon. Bugattis swept to victory in the Targa Florio for five years straight from 1925
        through 1929. Louis Chiron held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the modern marque revival Bugatti
        Automobiles S.A.S. named the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car in his honour. But it was the final racing
        success at Le Mans that is most remembered—Jean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron won the 1939 race with just one
        car and meagre resources.</p>
